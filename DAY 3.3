                                        ARRAYS IN JAVASCRIPT

 Iterable - object where you can use the for-of loop

 Array-like object - Any object with length property and use indexes to access items

 Arrays as Objects:  Arrays in JavaScript are a specific type of object that has numeric keys (indices) and a length property. 
 The indices are automatically maintained, and the length property is automatically updated when you add or remove elements from the array.

typeof Operator: The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for both arrays and regular objects.

 JavaScript Array is a data structure that allows you to store and organize multiple values within a single variable. It is a versatile and dynamic object. It can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed i.e. the first element is accessed with an index 0, the second element with an index of 1, and so forth.


                                          Creating Arrays:

  Arrays in JavaScript can be created using the Array constructor or with array literals (square brackets []).

  Using Array constructor

  Using array literal

  we can also create an empty array

  Accessing Elements:
  Accessing Elements:  Array elements are accessed using zero-based indices.


  Modifying Elements

  Modifying Elements: You can modify array elements by assigning new values to specific  indices.
